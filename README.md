# BPCsharp

I wanted to learn C# so I decided I'd try recreating my [autoAlignSample](https://github.com/mkvanleuven/autoAlignSample) project without the need for python wrappers.

Join a python programmer on this epic journey as he gets to grips with static typing, curly brackets and semicolons as I discover what a real programming language is.
